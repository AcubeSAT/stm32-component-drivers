### Sample project

This is a sample C++ project for the `STM32L476VG` development board.

It contains all the CMakeLists.txt files and the configuration necessary to test the

You can use the function in `Src/peripheral.cpp` to write your C++ code that's making use
of the peripheral header and source files.
